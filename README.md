# Applied II Final Project
Note: This was my final project for my Spring 2024 Applied Statistics II class. It uses KMeans and Spectral clustering on data from codon usage in genomic and mitochondrial DNA; I was interested in seeing if the codon clusters would split the organism data along taxonomic divisions. There is some user interaction required when selecting the number of Spectral clusters.
